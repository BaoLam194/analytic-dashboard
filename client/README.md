# Introducing DataDash

A online web-platform helping people to easily analyse their data without coding experience.

## Motivation

Over the past year, we’ve noticed that many beginners struggle to work with existing data analytics tools like Numpy, Pandas, or R, as they can be intimidating and complex to navigate. This creates a barrier for those who are interested in learning data analysis but lack a strong coding background.

To address this, we want to build a user-friendly platform that automates the process of data analysis and predictive modelling—making it easier for users to explore data and generate insights without needing to write extensive code.

## Aims

To make data analysis and predictive modelling more accessible for beginners by simplifying complex tools and reducing the need for coding.

We plan to develop a web-based platform that users can easily access and upload their datasets to. From there, we hope users will be able to explore their data, generate visualisations, and build predictive models with minimal manual input. We also aim to include automated processing and interpretation features, so that users can focus on understanding their results rather than dealing with technical complexities.

## Key Features

1. Automated Data Processing

2. User-Friendly Interface

3. Exploratory Data Analysis Tools

4. One-Click Predictive Modelling

5. Result Interpretation & Export
